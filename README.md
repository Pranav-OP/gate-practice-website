# gate_practice_website

I have created a responsive website that contains all the information about GATE, including duration, marking system, and subject-wise classification.

We have compiled all of the previous year's GATE CSE question papers and created this website so that you can solve the entire previous year's exam papers with the correct marking scheme and time limit.

You can see how well you performed in the mock test attempt as your result will be displayed at the end of the exam.

Hope you like it !!
